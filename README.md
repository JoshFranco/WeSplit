Practicing SwiftU, using the following link as the source of this project:
* https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/16


In this project I learn about the basic structure of SwiftUI apps, how to build forms and sections, creating navigation views and navigation bar titles, how to store program state with the @State property wrapper, how to create user interface controls like TextField and Picker, and how to create views in a loop using ForEach.
